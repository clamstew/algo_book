# Glossary

## A

Array- Data structure. Stores all data in a structured way. Fast insertion and deletion from the end of the array, but slow insertion and deletion elsewhere. Not aware of what is stored inside, but can go to any location in the array quickly.

## B

Base Case- Line in a recursive method that can solve the method without having to call itself.

## C

Caching- Process that allows for fast retrieval of commonly used or important data.

Call Stack- The stack of frames that are created during a recursive call.

Compiled Language- Programming language that has to have its code turned into a more basic language before it can be ran. (Opposite of an Interpreted Language)

## D

Dev Environment- The environment a developer works in. Includes the Operating System, the languages and the tools.

Duck Typing-

Dynamically Typed- Language that allows for a variable to contain any type of object. (Opposite of statically typed)

## E

## F

Frame- The state of a method that is saved during a recursive call.

Functional Programming- Programming paradigm that sees programming as the result of mathematical expressions. Avoids state and mutable data.

## G

Graph- Data structure. Used to model multi-connection objects, such as road maps or computer connections. Has a structure.

## H

Hash- Data structure. Stores data using key/value pairs. Has no structure, but has fast lookup time and insertion/deletion.

Heap- Data structure. Allows for fast determination of the largest or smallest item in a group of items. Fast insertion and removal. Very similar to a stack or queue, but more complicated. Can be built with an array.

## I

Interpreted Language- Programming language that is ran by an internal program on the computer. (Opposite of Compiled Language) <!-- Improve! -->

## J

## K

## L

Linked List- Data structure. <!-- More here! -->

## M

## N

## O

Object-oriented Programming- Programming paradigm that uses objects to store state and pass information.

## P

## Q

Queue- Data structure. Example of a First In, FIrst Out, data structure, meaning the first item added to the queue is the first item removed. Can be built using a linked list or (with slower performance) an array.

## R

Recursion- A way to solve methods that calls the method itself.

Recursive Case- Line in a method that cannot solve the method without calling itself again.

Ruby- Programming language. Dynamically typed object-oriented language that is interpreted. Popular for web development and scripting.

## S

Script- Program that runs other programs on a computer. (Example: Script that installs a dev environment)

Set- Data structure. Data structure that mimics the mathematical definition of a set. Can only hold one of a single object. Has no structure.

Sorting- Method(s) that sort objects in a data structure that has a physical structure. Commonly used on arrays.

Stack- Data structure. Example of a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning the last item added to the stack is the first item removed. Can be built using a linked list or an array.

State- The current value of all stored variables.

Statically Typed- Language that requires the datatype a variable will hold is set. The datatype cannot change while the program is running. (Opposite of dynamically typed)

## T

Tail-Call Optimization- Optimization technique of recursive methods that results in the recursive call not needing to return to the current stack to solve the problem. <!-- Improve! -->

Tree- Data structure. Used to model data that has many parent-child connections, such as file structures or the DOM model. Has a structure.
