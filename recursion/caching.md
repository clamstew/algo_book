# Caching

The concept of **caching** is an important one in web development. Sometime in your past, your web browser has started to slow down. Searching for an answer on the internet, one of the common responses is to clear your web cache. What was in your web cache? It held a number of files from websites you had visited recently so that you didn't have to download them from the internet. This can be very visible when visiting a new website with a lot of pictures. When you first visit the site, all of the pictures have to be downloaded from the website you're visiting. But if you visit it again shortly after, the load time is much faster! This is because the images you downloaded the first time were stored to your web cache. When you visited the website a second time, instead of downloading the images again, your computer grabbed them from your web cache, greatly speeding up your load time.

But that is just one example of caching.
