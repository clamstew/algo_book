# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is traditionally the first set of algorithms that students start learning about. Sorting algorithms have many uses and are relatively easy to build. There are many different types of sorting algorithms, from easy to implement but very slow algorithms, to complex but fast algorithms. There are also specialized versions of sorting algorithms for certain cases, such as radix sort.
The many use cases and differing types make sorting algorithms extremely interesting to study. We use numbers in our algorithms, but they can be used to sort anything.

That being said, when using Ruby, the built in `.sort` method is extremely optimized. `.sort` will (probably) beat any sorting algorithm that you might come up with because of its heavy optimization and the fact that it is written in C.

The first three algorithms we will cover, selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort, are very similar in how they operate. The details help to speed up the algorithm for specific cases. Merge sort is the next algorithm that we will cover, and it uses the idea of divide and conquer to sort. Next comes Quick Sort, which uses another take on divide and conquer to solve the sorting problem. Finally, Radix Sort is a specialized sorting algorithm that exploits low digit numbers to sort in a fast runtime.
