# Selection Sort

Selection sort was one of the first sorting algorithms invented and it is the first sorting algorithm we teach at MakerSquare.

The array above is what we will be sorting using selection sort. The general idea behind selection sort is we are trying to find the smallest number in the array. Once we know where the smallest number is, we swap it with the first element in the array. Now we know that the first element is sorted, so we can move on to the next element. Let's take a look at what it looks like.
