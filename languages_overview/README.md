# Languages Overview

There are many, many, many programming languages in the world today, and they are all different. However, there are several languages that have rose to the top and are used often for many different projects. The top 10 languages, according to IEEE, are as follows:
1. Java
2. C
3. C++
4. Python
5. C#
6. PHP
7. JavaScript
8. Ruby
9. R
10. Matlab

The top 10 web languages are:
1. Java
2. Python
3. C#
4. PHP
5. JavaScript
6. Ruby
7. PERL
8. HTML
9. Scala
10. Go

Even with all these different choices, there are some common threads that most languages follow. They break down into several different categories that have their own characteristics. 

## Language Types

### Object Oriented vs. Functional

Object oriented languages are built to mimic real life. Everything in the language (usually) is an object and this allows for powerful abstractions when you are coding that result in a more modular code base. So, what does it mean when everything is an object? An object in a program is all of the information associated with the given object and all of the methods the object can perform.

An example of an object could be the device you are reading this book on. Whether it is a computer, a phone or a tablet, you are manipulating an object. These devices have keys that allow you to make inputs, and the result of your inputs are then shown to you. You don't care what's going on in the inside as long as it gives you the output you want. Object oriented programming follows this idea of the object. Whatever is interacting with it does not care what is going on inside its methods, as long as it outputs the correct response.

Functional languages, on the other hand, try to stay away from the idea of state. They use functions to return the correct result and treat everything as a mathematical function to end at some result.

### Statically vs. Dynamically Typed

The battle between statically vs. dynamically typed languages has been long and brutal. Both sides of the fight have their own reasons for why they believe their side is right and there has been no way to determine what truly works best.

Statically typed languages require you to choose what datatype a variable is when you create it. This gives several advantages. Errors are easy to locate and occur early in the product when the datatype you are trying to pass into a method is the incorrect one. Setting a variable to a single datatype allows the program running it to become more efficient because they don't have to change the datatype later in the program.

Dynamically type languages, as you might have guessed, allow you to change the datatype of a variable at any point in the program. This has its own benefits, as well. The person programming is able to code more efficiently when they don't have to set every variable type. It also allows for better object oriented design. Polymorphism isn't as usefuly without a dynamically typed language.

### Compiled vs. Interpreted

Compiled versus interpreted languages is another battle that has proponents on both sides.

Compiled languages are languages that convert all of their source code into a lower level language before it is ran. This allows the program to run more efficiently at runtime. It also allows the compiler to test the code for potential errors before the code is actually ran.

Interpreted languages, on the other hand, do nothing to the code before runtime. An interpreter takes the code and converts it to low level code at runtime.
