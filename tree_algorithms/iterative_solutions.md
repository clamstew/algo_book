# Iterative Solutions

The iterative solutions for printing binary search trees are a bit more involved. Just like we used for the Depth First Search iterative solution, we will use a stack to keep track of what nodes to visit. However, because we want to do this in a specific order, the standard depth first search solution doesn't always work.
