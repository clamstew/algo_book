# Binary Trees

The binary tree is a specialized version of a tree. Its only rule is that a node can only have 0, 1, or 2 children.

We saw earlier in our tree implementation that we were using a hash or an array to store all the children of a node. For a binary tree, most implementations score the two children using two different variables, left and right. This gives the tree more structure in describing which side of a node a child is on and is useful for some binary tree algorithms later on, such as binary search trees and order printing.
