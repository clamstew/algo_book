# Data Structures
<!-- hilighting some vocab again! -->
**_Data types_** are objects that all share a property. The most common examples are strings, integers, floats, and booleans.

**_Data structures_** are abstract concepts that are used to hold data types or other data structures. Data structures are built in such a way that they can allow efficient operations on the data they contain.

Data structures are very important to web development and programming in general. When beginning programming, especially in Ruby, the array seems like the perfect data structure. It has all these built-in methods that you can use: sort, length, reverse, slice, pop, shift, max, min, and many more. There are so many things you can do with an array and the built-in methods that initially you never have to touch another data structure. However, once you start messing with larger and larger data sets, the array loses its allure. Speed suddenly becomes important. Operations that were almost instant are taking a couple seconds to get through and your website or application is slowing down. This is when an understanding of data structures becomes useful.

Ruby has several built-in data structures: arrays, queues, stacks, and hashes. There are other structures that have to be added manually or with a gem: trees and graphs. We're going to run through each one and examine when and why they are useful and how they work.
